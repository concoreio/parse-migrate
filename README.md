# Parse Migrate

  Parse Migrate are Parse’s way of propagating changes you make to your classes (adding a field, deleting a class, etc.) into your schema. They’re designed to be mostly automatic, but you’ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.
